- Management of a 'database' of created images
  - View list of existing images
  - Mount the selected disk image to the host machine to browse contents
  - Format disk image as a specific format and view partitions on the disk
  - Delete disk images you no longer require
  - Duplicate disk image you want, as to 'back up' the contents at the time

- Special commands for supported Operating Systems
   - On Linux based systems:
     - Easily create multiple OpenCore disk images for use with [DarwinKVM](https://docs.darwinkvm.com/)
     - Probe disk images for information and partitions
     - Pseudo QEMU NBD front-end.
   - On Darwin based systems:
     - Mount and unmount using hdiutil, with an interactive menu
     - Support for management of UTM disk images for DarwinUTM machines
