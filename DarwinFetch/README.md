# DarwinFetch
A Python script that allows for getting Online and Full Offline installer images for macOS

This README will eventually get a nice layout and images and logos and whatnot, but for right now, all you really need to know is that this Python project is only about 1/3 complete. Right now, it does as advertised and allows a user to Fetch both Offline and recoveryOS Installers for Mac OS X / macOS, as well as PowerPC variants of Mac OS X. Anyways:

<h2>Arch Linux:</h2>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./DarwinFetch.sh
```

<h2>macOS:</h2>

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./DarwinFetch.sh
```

<h2>Debian Linux:</h2>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./DarwinFetch.sh
```
