# Installation of Scripts
#### Script Installation thanks to RisingPrism!

{: .important }
If the <a href="">RisingPrism</a> scripts do not work, **or if you have an AMD card with the reset bug**, use the <a href="https://gitlab.com/akshaycodes/vfio-script">akshaycodes</a> scripts instead.

All AMD GPUs but the rDNA 2-based ones (6000 Series) have the reset bug. AK's scripts workaround it by sleeping and waking the system when stopping and starting the VM, if you want to avoid this, you can try using the usual RisingPrism scripts with [RadeonResetBugFix](https://github.com/inga-lovinde/RadeonResetBugFix) or [VendorReset](https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset).

We'll start by doing a ``git clone`` command to fetch the scripts.

``git clone https://gitlab.com/risingprismtv/single-gpu-passthrough.git``

In the newly created single-gpu-passthrough folder, run the installation as root:

``sudo chmod +x install_hooks.sh``

``sudo ./install_hooks.sh``

Verify that the files are installed correctly. You should have files in the following location:

```
/etc/systemd/system/libvirt-nosleep@.service
/bin/vfio-startup.sh
/bin/vfio-teardown.sh
/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
```

Because we previously set logs to output, you can find them here:

```
DarwinKVM.log    => /var/log/libvirt/qemu
custom_hooks.log => /var/log/libvirt/
libvirtd.log     => /var/log/libvirt/
```

But if the RisingPrism scripts aren't working well for you and you end up using akshaycodes, you can find the logs at:

```
custom_hooks.log => /var/tmp/vfio-script.log
```

## You can now continue to the next <a href="02-HookModification.html">page</a>.
