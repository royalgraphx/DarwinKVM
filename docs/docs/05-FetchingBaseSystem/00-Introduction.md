# Introduction / Overview

We'll be using a tool included [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) under Utilities called macrecovery. It's included in this repository. While I recommend getting the latest version of macOS available to you at the time, there is a chart on the next page which will allow you to select.

Download the following tools needed for modifications.

| Tool  | Status | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | Required | Needed as a dependency. |
| [macrecovery](https://github.com/royalgraphx/macrecovery) | Required | Allows you to fetch RecoveryOS images. |
