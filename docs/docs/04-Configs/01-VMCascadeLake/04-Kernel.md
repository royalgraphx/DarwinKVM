# Kernel

<p align="center">

</p>

## Add

This section of the config is meant to expose the various Kexts in your OC folder. This along with many of the other sections will be auto-filled by simply going to ``File -> OC Clean Snapshot`` and going to the OC folder in your OpenCore.img mount point.

## Block

Blocks certain Kexts from loading. Not relevant for us.

## Emulate

Needed for spoofing unsupported CPUs like Pentiums and Celerons. We are already spoofing the CPU to CascadeLake in the XML, so we won't need this.

- Cpuid1Mask: Leave this blank
- Cpuid1Data: Leave this blank

## Force

Used for loading Kexts off system volume, only relevant for older operating systems where certain kexts are not present in the cache, i.e IONetworkingFamily in 10.6.

For us, we can ignore.

## Patch

Patches both the kernel and Kexts. I've gone ahead and incorporated CaseySJ's PCI Bus Enumeration fix on KVM. For us, we can ignore this section.

## Quirks

Don't skip over this section, we'll be changing the following:

| Quirk  | Value | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ForceSecureBootScheme | True | Forces a compatible scheme for Apple Secure Boot Image verification. |
| PanicNoKextDump | True | Disables dumping of the loaded kexts when a kernel panic occurs, greatly helps with reading the panic output and debugging. |
| PowerTimeoutKernelPanic | True | Helps fix kernel panics relating to power timeouts with Apple drivers in macOS Catalina and above, most notably with digital audio. |
| ProvideCurrentCpuInfo | True | Provides current CPU info to the kernel. On KVM and other hypervisors it provides precomputed MSR 35h values to avoid some kernel panics. |

## Scheme

Settings related to legacy booting, but we can change the following.

| Key  | Type | Value | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | | ----- |
| CustomKernel | Boolean | False | Loads a custom kernel, usually used for unsupported CPUs. Here we spoof the CPU with QEMU so we do not require this. |
| FuzzyMatch | Boolean | False | Improves Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) booting times by utilizing a different algorithm, if you don't care about ancient macOS/Mac OS X versions, disable this. |
| KernelArch | String | x86_64 | Slightly improves boot performance by hardcoding that we're booting the kernel in AMD64 mode instead of x86. |
| KernelCache | String | Auto | Specifies the kernel cache type used, on modern macOS versions, this can be hardcoded to Prelinked to speed up boot times. |
