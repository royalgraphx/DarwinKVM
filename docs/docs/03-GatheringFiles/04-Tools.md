# Tools
#### This section has been derived from the <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/opencore-efi.html">Adding The Base OpenCore Files</a>. It may be out of date. Please refer to latest documentation when possible.

As far as I'm concerned, you only need OpenShell.efi and even then, that's only for debugging. It's already included within [DarwinOCPkg](https://github.com/royalgraphx/DarwinOCPkg).

| Tool  | Status | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| OpenShell.efi | Optional | Recommended for easier debugging. |

<h1>You can now proceed to the <a href="../04-Configs/">Configs</a> section!</h1>
