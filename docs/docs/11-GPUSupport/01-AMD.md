All Vega based dedicated GPUs are natively supported in macOS with Vega 20 GPUs starting in Mojave. In this case, they do work on the latest macOS and you can proceed.

# Vega 10

{: .highlight }
> Vega 10 GPUs are natively supported in macOS. In this case, they do work on the latest macOS and you can proceed. 
> "The only brand of GPUs to avoid with Vega 10 is XFX. The reason is VBIOS communication issues which can't be easily solved with a reference BIOS due to how Vega's powerplay table interacts with the OS and GPU."

# Polaris 10 and 20

{: .warning }
"Regarding Polaris, basically every model is supported. The only brands you should avoid with the Polaris series would be XFX, PowerColor, HIS and VisionTek as many users have had bootloader and macOS boot issues. In this case, they do work on the latest macOS and you can proceed.

## Lexa core based GPUs

{: .note }
Lexa based GPUs require a device-id property spoof to get the accelerator to match, the driver itself actually supports these cards yet there's no accelerator class. 

| Card | Initial Support | Latest Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RX 540 | None | None | Needs device-id spoof to 0x67FF, WhateverGreen's no-gfx-spoof propetry will also have to be enabled |

# Unsupported GPU's

{: .important }
While there are other GPU's that are supported up to Monterey and Big Sur, this guide focuses on the latest macOS, and unfortunately these cards below and others not mentioned, will not work in this guide without the user doing more manual modification, even as far as flashing custom VBIOS' which is out of the scope of this guide.

## Navi 2X and Navi 3X

{: .note }
While Navi 21, 22 and Navi 23 are supported, Navi 24 and Navi 3X based graphic cards are not at the time of writing. No guarantee can be made for future support.

| Card | Initial Support | Latest Support | Notes |

| RX 6400 | None | None |  |
| RX 6500 XT | None | None |  |
