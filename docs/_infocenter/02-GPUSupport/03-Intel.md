# macOS Intel iGPU Support Table
#### This section has been derived from various sources.

<br>

{: .warning }
This sections is currently a work in progress, and information here may be incorrect. (There is def incorrect info still.) If you seem to spot an error or have better information, please feel free to make a pull request for this page! Intel experts needed for validity/sanity check.

{: .headsup }
This support table does not indicate whether or not iGPU passthrough is possible on a given generation. This support table simply aims to store a local copy of supported iGPUs within various Mac OS X / macOS releases. If managed to be passed through to a guest, they should *theoretically* work. Be aware it will still require the usual configuration within OpenCore.

# Ice Lake

{: .note }
Most iGPUs in the generation have support (except the unsupported "UHD Graphics" G1)

| Card | Initial Support | Latest Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Iris Plus G4 | Catalina (10.15.4) | Sequoia (15) |  |
| Iris Plus G7 | Catalina (10.15.4) | Sequoia (15) |  |

# Kaby/Coffee/Whiskey/Comet Lake (Refresh/Non-Refresh)

{: .note }
Most iGPUs are supported here (except the UHD 610 in the i5-10200H), though pay attention as the i3-8100 and i3-8350K use a [different UHD 630](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Graphics_Technology#Kaby_Lake_Refresh_/_Amber_Lake_/_Coffee_Lake_/_Whiskey_Lake) (184 shader units vs 192 shader units) than the rest of the CPU family which requires spoofing for support in High Sierra and above.

| Iris Plus 645 | High Sierra (10.13.6) | Sequoia (15) |  |
| Iris Plus 655 | High Sierra (10.13.6) | Sequoia (15) |  |

# Skylake

{: .note }
Ventura (13) dropped support for Skylake iGPUs. However, since Skylake and Kaby Lake iGPUs are so similar, Skylake iGPUs can be spoofed as Kaby Lake in order to make use of the Kaby Lake kexts, which are still present in Sonoma.
