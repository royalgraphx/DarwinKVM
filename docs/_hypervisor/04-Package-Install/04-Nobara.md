This page is incomplete! No personal testing has been done yet. Please open a PR to complete this page if you are a user who has completed DKVM on Nobara.

<p align="center">To get started, we'll use the default package manager <code>   </code> to install varaious packages/software including but not limited to Virt-Manager and QEMU itself.</p>

| Package | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|  |  |

<p align="center">You can install all the necessary packages using <code>   </code> by running the following command:</p>

```bash
sudo 
```

<p align="center">If you use any other package manager on Nobara, or similarly based distributions, and would like to contribute to this page, please request a PR review for accelerated addition. It's understandable that some people may already be on an existing installation for a while now, and use entirely different package managers.</p>
