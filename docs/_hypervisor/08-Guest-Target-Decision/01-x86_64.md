<p align="center">DarwinKVM provides the ability to run every major and minor OS X and macOS release on Intel platforms. This includes for those on AMD CPUs. Normally, on bare metal, you cannot use anything below High Sierra due to AMD Vanilla Patches. This means that DarwinKVM provides the ability for AMD and modern Intel users alike to run instances of Snow Leopard or Tiger, given that you have a compatible and natively supported GPU for that version. The gallery demonstrates an ATI HD 5450 being used for something like Snow Leopard. For extended support, check the GPU Support Chart for purchasing ideas and known working cards extracted from the various Kexts that OS X ships with. </p>

<p align="center">Thank you for reading the Hypervisor Configuration section. You will now begin to create an OpenCore EFI disk image, that is configured as a Mac Model, as described above. This means, the next section is going to teach you how to create a blank FAT32 raw <code>.img</code> file, that you can mount and modify to create and configure an OpenCore EFI set to present the standard QEMU Q35 machine to your desired OS X or macOS release, as the Mac model that supported it.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Remember, if you want Mojave or older, you must have installed DUDK-Firmware in the Package Installation page. Ensure you also are configuring OpenCore as <code>MacPro5,1</code>.</b></p>
