<h2 align="center">Why use Terminal manually?</h2>

<p align="center">Most users, would prefer to simply open a Terminal, and begin manually managing their own virtual disk images. This works great for those advanced enough to do such a task, or those who simply prefer a server based version of Linux that does not include a Desktop Environment. This also works for those on Proxmox/Unraid who have SSH access and a portion of storage they can work under.</p>
