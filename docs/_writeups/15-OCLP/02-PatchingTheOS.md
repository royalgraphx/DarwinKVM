# Patching the OS

To get started, download a copy of [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher), move this to your Applications folder and run the app.

Once it loads, you should be greeted with several options, click ``Post-Install Root patch`` and OCLP should start working its magic.

When it's all done, it should prompt you to reboot and in no time you'll be up and running!
