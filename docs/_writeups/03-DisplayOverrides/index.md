This guide will cover the basics of using macOS's Display Overrides ability to fix some issues with incompatible displays when using a hac. You'll first need to determine what is wrong with your current display. Possible fixes that are covered in this write-up are below.

| Issue | Fix |
| ---- | ----- |
| Display is recognized as a TV in System Information, thus does not allow a user to use Night Shift | Can use DisplayIsTV False override |
| HiDPI modes are not supported or do not appear | Possible to make them appear in settings by overriding supported resolutions list. |
