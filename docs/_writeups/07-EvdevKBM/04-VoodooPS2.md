## Adding VoodooPS2

> This is only for MacOS 10.14 (Mojave) And Older! For **OS X 10.11** (El Capitan) and lower, you will instead need to download the original PS2 driver by **RehabMan** <a href="https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-voodoo-ps2-controller/downloads/">here</a>. Note that these older drivers are built for x64 systems, but you can manually build the x32 versions in Xcode with the source code <a href="https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Voodoo-PS2-Controller/">here</a>.
{: .headsup }
Start by downloading the latest release version of ``VoodooPS2`` from <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooPS2/releases/">here</a> (for macOS 10.12 Sierra and higher).

Add the kext to the Kexts folder in your OpenCore disk image, and remember to ``OC Snapshot`` the ``config.plist`` when finished. The necessary kexts (``VoodooPS2Keyboard, VoodooPS2Mouse``) will be added automatically for you by ProperTree.

Now, boot up macOS, and enjoy switching your keyboard and mouse from macOS to Linux!

{: .note }
>  Usually, the **Option (⌥)** and **Command (⌘)** keys on the keyboard maps to the **Alt** and the **Windows (⊞)** keys respectively. The original PS2 driver (by RehabMan) will swap these keymaps, however.
> 
> You can change this behavior is to go to **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Modifier Keys** (or something equivalent) in macOS, and swap the action keys for Option (⌥) and Command (⌘).
