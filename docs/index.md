<h1 align="center">Requirements</h1>

* A compatible graphics card. <b>This is a must, don't bother if you're not getting GPU Accel.</b> please reference this <a href="docs/11-GPUSupport/01-AMD">chart</a> to verify.
  * There are some exceptions, if you're crazy and want to use a legacy NVIDIA GPU, please reference this <a href="docs/11-GPUSupport/02-NVIDIA">chart</a> to check macOS/OCLP compatibility. If it's supported, there is a writeup for Legacy NVIDIA Patching.

* A modern Linux distribution. E.g. Arch Based for the latest packages. My personally tested and working list is:
  * EndeavourOS
  * ArcoLinuxB Plasma
  * Pure Arch

* A CPU with Intel VT-x or AMD SVM support is required (`grep -e vmx -e svm /proc/cpuinfo`)

* A CPU with SSE4.1 support is required for >= macOS Sierra

* A CPU with AVX2 support is required for >= macOS Ventura; but you can bypass the limitation with CryptexFixup as of now.

* Previous experience creating an EFI for your bare metal system and/or reading/understanding the [Dortania OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).

* Various Software/Packages. some optional, some not.

* <b>PATIENCE! This is NOT a Pre-Built EFI! You are responsible for completing it!</b>
