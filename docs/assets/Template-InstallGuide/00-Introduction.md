**1. Valid Python Install**

- This will allow you to use tools like "OC Clean Snapshot" which will scan your OC folder and add the various files to your config.plist automatically and in the correct order.

**3. GenSMBIOS**
- Required to generate a serial number, you cannot log into iServices until you properly generate SMBIOS information and use that on your config.plist

- Base that you change to config.plist, and begin to modify.
